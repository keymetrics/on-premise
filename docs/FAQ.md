#### What are the services that are used ?

- http API on port 3010 (access the data, configure bucket etc)
- auth service on port 3100 (register/login etc)
- websocket service on port 4010 (so the frontend can receive update in realtime)
- interaction on port 3900 (listen for PM2 data)
- reverse interaction on port 43554 (listen for a specific connection from PM2, used to send command to it like restart etc)

#### What is exposed by default ?

Depending on how you deployed the keymetrics enterprise product, there are different answers : 
 - **Docker** :
     - nginx is used to load balance depending on the path, to either the frontend or backend services
     - km-front expose the frontend on the port 80
     - km-api expose all the backend services
 - **GCP** : 
     - Same as docker
     - Wizard application


#### I get a error about `Unknown modifier: $pushAll`, what did i miss ?

We only support mongodb up to version 3.4 for now, you need to downgrade.

#### How do i configure my pm2 to connect to it ?

When you first register, you should have a bucket created automatically, then you will have connection data in the middle in this format : 

```
> KEYMETRICS_NODE=<your KM_SITE_URL> pm2 link <identifier_one> <identifier_two>
```

You have two way to link your pm2 : 
  - Connect to the instance where pm2 is and run the command.
  - If you have container, just add these environements variables :
    - `KEYMETRICS_PUBLIC`: replace with `identifier_two>`
    - `KEYMETRICS_SECRET`: replace with `<identifier_one>`
    - `KEYMETRICS_NODE`: replace with `<your KM_SITE_URL>`
    - `INSTANCE_NAME`: (optional) replace it if you want your server in keymetrics to have a fixed name

Then it should all the instances in the keymetrics frontend in realtime.

#### How should i run pm2 inside my containers to connect to it ? 

We advise you to use `pm2-runtime`, it should be a dropin replacement for node inside your images : 

```
FROM node:8-alpine

RUN npm install -g pm2 2> /dev/null
[ ... ]
CMD [ "pm2-runtime", "app.js" ] # note that you can use an ecosystem here too
```

You can find the flags that you can use [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/blob/master/lib/binaries/Runtime4Docker.js#L17)
